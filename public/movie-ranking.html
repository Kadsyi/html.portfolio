        <h3>White Sun of the Desert</h3>

        <h3>Grave of the Fireflies</h3>
        <p>Film hits us with the weight of the story right from the beginning with the opening line: main character, a little boy telling us when he died. This is a tragic movie taking place in Japan during the Second World War, not for the faint hearted.</p><br />

        <h3>Come and See</h3>
        <p>Another heart wrenching film set during WW2 but this one takes place in the Nazi occupied Soviet Union. Excellent use of visuals and audio along with brilliant acting passes emotions it wants to convey perfectly. You will be nailed to your seat for a while when the movie ends.</p><br />
